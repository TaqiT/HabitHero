My name is Taqi Tahmid, a first-year student at Drexel University, working towards a degree in Computing and Security Technology with a Minor in Computer Science. My interests lie in cybersecurity and bioinformatics. I hope to one day work for the government as a cybersecurity specialist in the public sector.
