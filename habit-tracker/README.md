# Evans Delete Button Testing 

# Context
Tested to see if Evan's Delete button works and keeps its functionality without interfering with the other aspects of the app.
Previously, I had tried to make a to take on this task, but I had unsuccessfully attempted it and split it into 2 tasks leaving the functionality feature for Evan. 


# Testing
I had went in and tested the button to see how it will keep up with our various acceptance criterias. 

- Acceptance Critiera 1: when the user presses the delete button it removes the selected task from the task list: 

    - The button is able to delete the user's tasks and it removes it from the users view in the Task screen. Originally there was a problem that it did not remove itself from task tab, however this issue is resolved. 
    - The button also does not intefere with the other tasks on Task Screen as well. 


- Acceptance Criteria 2: delete task" touchable opacity provides a clear understandable visual for the user that if they were to click the button they would be able to go about with deleting the desired task
    
    - The button appears to seem very easy to understand, the user taps on the task they want to delete and the options to delete them are aviable to their disposal. 
    - The button also does not clutter the screen and is visually appealing and accessible for the average user. 


# Conclusion

The button works as its intended and clearly has its benefits to improve the User experience by providing the user with an understandable method of deleting unwanted tasks, thus granting them added features to the app.
